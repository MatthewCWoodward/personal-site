							<h2>Introduction</h2>
							<p>
								Hi, I'm Matthew Woodward, a second-year electrical engineering undergrad at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I am currently pursuing a bachelor's of science with concentrations in electric energy systems and circuit technology.<br><br>
								I am searching for power systems engineering internships in the fall, spring, or summer. I will bring a dedicated, self-starter work ethic to the position. I am interested in working with high-voltage power system structures or engineering drawings in a role where I will be able to apply my AutoCAD skills and analytical mindset.<br><br>
								<span class="dark-text">VISION:</span> This website serves as an up-to-date repository for the projects I participate in and build, skills I develop, and organizations I am involved in to showcase my depth and personality.

							<h2>Future Career Goals</h2>
							<p>
								In the next five years, I plan to graduate with a BS in electrical engineering and enroll in the joint BS/MS program for electrical engineering at Georgia Tech. Concentrating in electric energy systems and circuit technology during my BS degree will allow me to identify topics I enjoy studying -- to which I will then pursue further during my MS degree.<br><br>
								I ultimately plan to work in engineering consulting, focusing on electrical systems within public buildings. My studies of electric energy systems and circuit technology during my undergrad, along with a more in-depth exploration during my MS degree, will teach me how to work with the complex electrical circuitry and sustainability considerations necessary when designing modern buildings.<br><br>
								In order to prepare myself as much as possible for my career, it is paramount that I obtain real-world experience as a student. Not only will internships in the field of electrical systems in buildings allow me to practice the relevant skills as a student, it will also expose me to the types of skills, characteristics, and qualifications that would allow me to excel in that field. As such, I will pursue an internship in this field each summer before I graduate. This summer I have accepted an offer as an electrical engineering intern with TLC Engineering, an engineering consulting firm that designs sustainable electrical systems in public buildings.<br><br>
								Something intensely important to me when considering a future career is the impact that my hard work will have. Whether that impact makes a difference through a community I'm working with or a product I'm helping build, it's a validation of the effort and dedication I put into my career. The need for impact is one of the main reasons I aim to pursue a career in engineering consulting. I look forward to the day that I am able to show family and friends the buildings around my city that I had a hand in helping design its electrical systems.

							<h2>Next Steps to Career</h2>
							<p>
								In an effort to fully develop myself and begin building the skills necessary to accomplish the endeavors I hope to in my career, I have researched relevant job positions and the skills desired. Below is a list of competencies I am continuously working towards acquiring or building:<br><br>
								&emsp;- AutoCAD (beginner)<br>
								&emsp;- Revit (beginner)<br>
								&emsp;- Load analysis (beginner)<br>
								&emsp;- High-voltage distribution systems (beginner)<br>
								&emsp;- Electrical design validation (beginner)<br><br>
								The list above is updated regularly based on my progress and level of competency. The current goal is to reach "intermediate" level competency on these skills is end of Summer 2021.

							<h2>About Me</h2>
							<p>
								Being an active and helping member within my communities is something that I strive for wherever I go. Despite the
								virtual challenges we faced during the pandemic, I have found ways to stay involved on campus. During this previous
								semester, Spring 2021, I served as the Director of Internal Professional Programming for Georgia Tech's premier co-ed
								business fraternity, Alpha Kappa Psi. In this role, I served as a leader in professionalism for a 60+ person Brotherhood and grew invaluable skills in leadership, communication, and professionalism. I developed these skills through	constantly being involved and leading the professional-building opportunities for the Brotherhood. Through activities such as heading weekly lessons on the Psychology of Success or constructing two professional workshops, which served as an integral part of the fraternity's Pledge education program, I grew immensely. In fact, I enjoyed the role so much,	that I recently campaigned and was elected to serve as the Vice President of Professional Programming for the upcoming academic year!<br><br>
								An involvement in my community that I will always be proud of is my Eagle Scout project. It was the last requirement
								before attaining the rank of Eagle Scout, and it allowed me to give back to a community that had given me so much. For
								the project, I built an outdoor learning area for Johns Creek United Methodist Church's preschool, restored a nearby
								walkway, and refurbished multiple picnic tables to their original conditions. The entire process demanded approximately 80 hours of planning, leading, and communicating on my part and took much longer than expected with a nine-month development period, demonstrating my perseverance and diligence. Although a challenging experience, it is one that I'll never forget for all of the hard work, leadership, and passion that made me into who I am today.

							<h2>Interests and Passions</h2>
							<p>
								When I'm not studying for my classes, you can find me on the soccer pitch where I've been playing for over 10 years, reading a good book studying investor psychology, a topic I love, or on my computer honing in on my coding skills. <br><br>
								I am a self-taught computer scientist who enjoys all different kinds of programming languages and building projects with those langauges to expand on my programming abilities (such as the one you're viewing right now!). This website was built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and I am currently learning C++. All of the programming knowledge that I have gained has been through independent study and a result of hard work and dedication to broadening my skills.
